## Usage

Before proceeding, ensure the following tools are installed and accessible from your command line or terminal:

- **GNU Make**
- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**

### Compile

- To run the program, first run make in the terminal. There are 3 different versions of the code you can run. make exec, make redir, make pipe. Depending on the version you want to run, type in the associated command for it.

```
make <exec|redir|pipe>
```

### Run

Pass arguments `Pi` for test inputs as integers.

```
./autograder <test_dir> <P1> <P2> ... <Pi>
```

## Assumptions

There are no assumptions to be made. Only that batch size is set by the system's processor count.
